            "faq_answer": "Moku is a mushroom based jerky that was developed to look and taste like meat.  We use clean, allergen-free ingredients that are good for your body and the planet."

            "faq_question": "Why is this better than beef jerky?",
            "faq_answer": "The increased rate of beef production is taking a monumental toll on our planet and it's only getting worse. More and more forest land is being destroyed in order to pave the way for industrial cattle ranching. Moku's jerky is made from king oyster mushrooms which grow indoors and require very little water and sunlight, making them one of the most sustainable foods on Earth.  Moku also packs 7g of fiber compared to zero grams of fiber in a bag of beef jerky."

            "faq_answer": "Moku means “land division” in Hawaiian.  Rooted in our founder's Hawaiian upbringing, Moku's mission is to create food that will preserve our land rather than destroy it."

            "faq_answer": "We'd love to but to preserve a food like jerky, there are no compostable options out there yet that can create a barrier which allows for a long shelf life.  We're working on it though!"
